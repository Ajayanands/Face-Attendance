## 📸 Overview

The **Face Recognition Attendance System** automates the process of marking attendance using facial recognition — replacing traditional methods like manual entry, ID cards, or biometric punch-ins. Built using Python, OpenCV, and simple local storage, it’s designed to run smoothly on low-end devices without requiring a GPU or cloud support.

This project is ideal for:

- Schools and colleges with limited hardware resources
- Small-scale offices or organizations
- Developers learning about practical computer vision applications

## 🛠️ Features

- 🎥 Real-time face detection and recognition using a webcam
- 📝 Automatic CSV-based attendance logging with timestamp
- 🧑‍💻 User-friendly UI built using Streamlit or Flask
- 🧾 Admin interface for registration and report export
- 🔐 Privacy-focused: runs completely offline (no cloud)
